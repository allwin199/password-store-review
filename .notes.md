# About the project, in my own words

A user should be able to set a password, and retrieve it. Other users should not be able to see my password.

# Attack Vector ideas

1. setPassword function says only the owner can set the password.
   It dosen't have a onlyOwner modifier or some sort of restriction.
   Anyone can call setPassword and update the password.

2. Password is set for the user but it is visible to everyone.
